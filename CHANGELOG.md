# Changelog

All notable changes to **precept-research** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This repo has no semver public API; the
stable contract is the `RunManifest` and `ExperimentConfig` schemas (see CLAUDE.md). Behaviour- or
result-affecting changes get an entry; result-affecting changes also re-freeze the affected result.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **DSE-001** — Repository scaffolding: PEP 621 `pyproject.toml` (uv-managed, pip-installable),
  `src/preceptx/` package layout with typed subpackages (`sim`, `agents`, `serving`, `data`,
  `measure`, `gate`, `experiments`, `analysis`), floor-and-ceiling pinned dependencies with
  `serving`/`embed`/`data`/`dev` extras, GitHub Actions CI (lint / typecheck / test on Python 3.11),
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.gitignore`, and a README setup stub.
- **DSE-002** — Serving harness: `scripts/myriad/serve.sh` parameterised SGE jobscript (vLLM greedy
  decoding, fixed seed, pinned revision, xgrammar guided decoding, per-tier GPU mapping);
  `src/preceptx/serving/client.py` `LLMClient` (chat + structured JSON-schema calls, temperature 0,
  seed, retries, health check, graceful shutdown); mock-endpoint unit tests; `docs/serving.md`.
- Planning scaffolding: `CHANGELOG.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md` (critical path, ticket dependency graph,
  runtime deps, risk register, cross-cutting concerns, phase/freeze gates).
- **DSE-003** — Config, seeding, manifest, determinism: Hydra config tree under `configs/`
  (condition × serialisation × difficulty × model × seed, composed via `@_global_` groups);
  `src/preceptx/config.py` (`ExperimentConfig`/`ModelConfig` Pydantic models, `load_config` wrapping
  validation errors as `ConfigError`, mandatory pinned model revision); `src/preceptx/seeding.py`
  (`set_global_seed` for Python/NumPy/torch, with documented LLM-determinism limits);
  `src/preceptx/manifest.py` (`RunManifest` with git SHA, config hash, dep versions, command, seed,
  revisions, metrics; `build_manifest`/`write_manifest`/`read_manifest`); `src/preceptx/determinism.py`
  + `scripts/determinism_check.py` (repeat a fixed-seed structured call and report agreement rate and
  numeric variance); unit + property + integration tests.
- **DSE-004** — Handoff dataset: `src/preceptx/data/schema.py` (`HandoffRecord` Pydantic contract,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION`, four `Y`-label placeholders for DSE-009); `src/preceptx/data/writer.py`
  (append-safe hash-stamped Parquet parts with a pinned Arrow schema, `register_dataset` index,
  `load_dataset` frame + `load_records` exact round-trip, `dataset_hash`);
  `src/preceptx/data/otel_capture.py` (`emit_handoff` via the vanilla OpenTelemetry SDK, fail-open,
  no precept dependency); `docs/handoff_schema.md`; unit, property, and OTel tests.

### Changed
- Repositioned `ISSUES.md` and `RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md` to the **standalone** posture mandated by
  CLAUDE.md: the repo does not depend on or import precept. OTel capture (DSE-004) uses a vanilla
  OpenTelemetry SDK exporter; the runtime gate (DSE-018) is the in-repo `RuntimeGate`
  (`gate/integration.py`, formerly `precept_integration.py`). Dissertation/project naming and the
  "upstream to precept later" framing are unchanged.
- Renamed planning docs to the canonical names CLAUDE.md references:
  `ISSUES - 15 June.md` → `ISSUES.md`, `RESEARCH_ROADMAP-15 June.md` → `RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md`.
- Isolated `sentence-transformers` (and its `torch` dependency) to an `embed` extra rather than core,
  so the analysis install and CI stay fast and torch-free. Deviation from the roadmap's primary-deps
  list, noted in `DEPENDENCIES.md` §3.
- CI runs Python 3.11 only (CLAUDE.md's pinned-single-version rule), narrowing DSE-001's stated
  3.11/3.12 matrix.

### Notes
- DSE-002's live-on-Myriad verification (one tier served + health check passing on the cluster)
  is deferred until cluster access is available; all authorable parts (script, client, mock tests,
  docs) are complete.
- DSE-003's determinism harness is verified against a mocked endpoint; the real fixed-seed run on the
  served 8B tier (DSE-003 acceptance) is deferred until Myriad access, like DSE-002's live check. The
  config-tree model revisions are placeholder `main` and must be pinned to commit SHAs before any
  recorded run (`ModelConfig` already rejects an empty revision).
